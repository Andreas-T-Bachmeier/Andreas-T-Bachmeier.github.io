            <h1>Introducing fibulaXpand: An Innovative Solution Revolutionizing Bone Repair</h1>
            <p>With fibulaXpand we’ve developed a groundbreaking approach to repairing severely injured limbs potentially saving them from amputation. Our innovative system enlarges the diameter of a bone and grows an autologous bone graft within the patient enabling faster recovery and a return to daily activities.</p>

                <!-- Vadim's Story -->
                <h2>But first, Vadim's Story: One fate among many others</h2>
                <p>Meet Vadim, a 21-year-old Ukrainian soldier who sustained a severe leg injury during the Russian invasion. Despite surviving, his right shinbone was shattered leading to a severe infection. Conventional treatments suggested amputation, devastating news for someone so young.</p>
                
                <p>There are methods to spare him from amputation. However, for many patients like Vadim, the traditional method of bone lengthening presents significant challenges. This method requires a metal frame to be placed outside the leg fixed to the bone with wires that penetrate the skin.</p>
                
                <h3>The main Drawbacks:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Extended Healing Time: Vadim would need to live with the external frame for approximately two years until his bone fully heals.</li>
                    <li>High Complication Risk: The metal frame significantly restricts movement and increases the risk of new infections.</li>
                    <li>Daily Discomfort: The frame would prevent Vadim from wearing normal trousers and force him to spend most of his time in a wheelchair.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="image-container left">
                    <a href="Images/established.png" target="_blank"><img src="Images/established.png" alt="Established method for bone defect reconstruction with external system"></a>
                </div>
                <p>Understandably, Vadim was appalled by the prospect of this cumbersome and restrictive treatment which would greatly impact his quality of life for an extended period.</p>
                <p>However, with the FibulaXpand technology, there is hope for Vadim to regain full use of his leg.</p>

            <div class="content-wrapper section">
                <!-- FibulaXpand Process -->
                <h2>The fibulaXpand Process</h2>
                <p>Our method known as "Fibula Expansion" leverages the body's own fibula, a non-weight-bearing bone in the lower leg. By expanding the fibula within the body we can increase its diameter to match the damaged femur allowing for the insertion of a robust bone graft.</p>

                <p>This is how it works. First, the fibula is expanded:</p>
                <div class="image-container right">
                    <a href="Images/2_expansionfibula.png" target="_blank"><img src="Images/2_expansionfibula.png" alt="Expansion of the fibula"></a>
                </div>
                <p>Then, the fibula can be resected and the graft can be implanted into the bone defect. Stabilization is achieved with an intramedullary nail and the bone can heal afterwards.</p>
                <div class="image-container left">
                    <a href="Images/3_transplantation.png" target="_blank"><img src="Images/3_transplantation.png" alt="transplantation of the fibula"></a>
                </div>
                <p>This internal procedure significantly reduces treatment time and complications, promoting faster and more comfortable healing.</p>
                <p>The whole procedure is illustrated in the following:</p>
                <div class="image-container right">
                    <a href="Images/1_operativetechnique.png" target="_blank"><img src="Images/1_operativetechnique.png" alt="Complete process to reconstruct a bone defect with fibula expansion"></a>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="content-wrapper section">
                <!-- Innovative System -->
                <h2>Innovative System for Fibula Expansion</h2>
                <p>To perform the fibulaXpand procedure, a specialized system is required to expand the fibula. This system, developed exclusively by us, addresses a significant gap in current medical technology. The core of our concept is a cylindrical balloon that expands by gradually introducing liquid through a syringe connector.</p>
                
                <div class="image-container left">
                    <a href="Images/4_concept.png" target="_blank"><img src="Images/4_concept.png" alt="Concept of FibulaXpand system"></a>
                </div>
                <p>This is how it works:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Insertion:</strong> The balloon, initially without any liquid, is inserted into the gap created by halving the fibula.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bone Formation:</strong> As new bone tissue forms in the gap, the balloon remains in place.</li>
                    <li><strong>Expansion:</strong> Over 10 days, the balloon is gradually expanded by adding liquid, stretching the callus and increasing the fibula's diameter.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>We have successfully implemented this concept in physical prototypes to prove its viability and effectiveness.</p>
